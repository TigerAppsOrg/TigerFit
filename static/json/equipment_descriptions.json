    "Dumbell Bench Press": "The bench press, or chest press, is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the trainee presses a weight upwards while lying on a weight training bench. The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.",
    "Barbell Incline Bench Press": "The incline barbell press is a free weight exercise designed to target the chest, shoulders, and triceps, hitting each side of the body independently. Unlike the more traditional flat bench press, the incline press shifts the focus of the movement to the upper portion of the pectoral muscle groups and the front of the shoulder. This allows for greater hypertrophy (muscle growth) of the upper chest when the exercise is performed regularly.",
    "Dumbell Incline Bench Press": "The incline dumbell press is a free weight exercise designed to target the chest, shoulders, and triceps, hitting each side of the body independently. Unlike the more traditional flat bench press, the incline press shifts the focus of the movement to the upper portion of the pectoral muscle groups and the front of the shoulder. This allows for greater hypertrophy (muscle growth) of the upper chest when the exercise is performed regularly.",
    "Barbell Decline Bench Press": "In a decline bench press, the bench is set to 15 to 30 degrees on a decline. This angle places your upper body on a downward slope, which activates the lower pectoral muscles as you push weights away from your body.",
    "Dumbell Decline Bench Press": "In a decline bench press, the bench is set to 15 to 30 degrees on a decline. This angle places your upper body on a downward slope, which activates the lower pectoral muscles as you push weights away from your body.",

    "Hip Abduction": "Hip abduction refers to the movement of the hip joint as the leg is moved away from the midline of the body. As the hip is composed of a ball and socket joint, a degree of rotation is also present during this motion. A group of muscles contribute to hip abduction; the most important of these is the gluteus medius.",
    "Hip Adduction": "Hip adductors are the muscles in your inner thigh that support balance and alignment. These stabilizing muscles are used to adduct the hips and thighs or move them toward the midline of your body.",
